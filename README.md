Analyzing Air quality as a result from the Thomas Fire


The Thomas Fire caused extensive damage in both Ventura and Santa Barbara County in December of 2017. As with all fires, the decrease in air quality index is a a direct effect of wildfires. This project will explore how the air quality index was effected by the Thomas fire. We will look into both numeric AQI data of santa barbara, as well as a collection of bands from the Landsat 8 Satellite. Looking into these different areas will allow us to further investigate how much the air quality index was affected, and from what bands the effect could be seen, if at all.
